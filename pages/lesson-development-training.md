Collaborative Lesson Development Training teaches essential skills
and good practices for designing and developing a lesson as an open source project.
The training will guide you through the design process and initial development of a new lesson,
prepare you to work with the infrastructure we use to build accessible, open source lesson websites,
and provide some advice and techniques for effective collaboration on the project.


## About the training

### Target audience
Collaborative Lesson Development Training is aimed at
Carpentries community members who have an idea for a new lesson
and want to begin developing it into an open source lesson website,
in collaboration with others.
[The curriculum][cldt-curriculum] was developed with a focus on
lessons for short-format training (e.g. two-day workshops),
but most of the skills and principles taught are applicable to
all curriculum design.

### What will you learn?
The training teaches fundamental concepts, skills, and good practice
in three key areas:

* **Lesson design and development**
* **Collaboration**
* **Using The Carpentries lesson infrastructure**

After attending this training, participants will be able to:

* collaboratively develop and publish lessons
  using The Carpentries lesson infrastructure
* identify and characterise the target audience for a lesson
* define _SMART_ learning objectives
* explain the pedagogical value of authentic tasks
* create exercises for formative assessment
* explain how considerations of cognitive load should influence
  the pacing, length, and organisation of a lesson
* use best practices to configure and maintain accessible and usable lesson repositories
  that are readily available for collaboration
* identify and correct accessibility issues in a lesson
  built on The Carpentries lesson infrastructure
* use feedback and reflection from teaching to update and improve lesson material
* review and provide constructive feedback on lessons


### Training structure
The training takes place in two parts,
separated by an extended break where participants test their new lessons.

In the first part, trainees will learn about backward lesson design,
including techniques for the development of effective exercises and accessible lesson content.
Trainees will define the target audience and intended learning outcomes of their lesson,
produce an outline of the lesson content and narrative,
and prepare exercises and examples for a chosen section.
They will also be introduced to [The Carpentries Workbench][workbench],
the infrastructure that the community uses to create lessons.
Applying these skills as they learn,
trainees will begin building their new material into an open source lesson website.

Trainees will trial part of their new lesson with a real audience
during the break between this first part and the conclusion of the training,
using this opportunity to gather vital feedback on their lesson design.

When they return for the second and final part of the training,
trainees will reflect on this experience
and discuss how to approach the remaining stages of lesson development.
In the concluding stages of the training,
trainees will learn principles and practices
to ensure they can continue to collaborate effectively on the project.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Who teaches Collaborative Lesson Development Training?
Our Lesson Developer Trainers are experts in curriculum development
drawn from The Carpentries community.
They have a wealth of experience in design, development, and maintenance of lessons
gathered from activities both within and outside The Carpentries.
The majority of Trainers are volunteers
and all have been certified through a multi-week program of Trainer Training
coordinated by the Curriculum Team.

### How do Collaborative Lesson Development Training events run?
Collaborative Lesson Development Training is taught virtually,
over the Zoom video conferencing platform.
Trainers make extensive use of screen sharing and breakout rooms during the training,
enhanced by live demonstration and a shared notes document.
The training is highly interactive,
with participants engaging frequently in discussion and hands-on activities,
designing and beginning to create their new lessons
as they progress through the training.

Participants join Collaborative Lesson Development Training in teams of two to five people,
collaborating together on a single lesson.

### Is Instructor Training a prerequisite for Collaborative Lesson Development Training?
At least one person in the lesson team must have attended
The Carpentries Instructor Training before the group can participate in
Collaborative Lesson Development Training.

### How important is it for multiple people to join Collaborative Lesson Development Training as a team?
Efforts have been made to make the Collaborative Lesson Development Training curriculum
suitable for individuals who want to develop a lesson alone.
However, we believe that the lesson development process is likely to be more successful
(and more enjoyable!) when it is a collaborative effort among multiple contributors.
We encourage those interested in joining the training to find
at least one other person to join the training with them.
This is reflected in the pricing of the training.

### What options exist for a lesson after the training?
Participants will leave the training with
the foundations of a lesson and a plan for how to continue developing it.
[The Carpentries Incubator][incubator] provides a platform for collaborative curriculum development
supported by the community and the Curriculum Team.
Mature lessons from the Incubator can be submitted for open peer review in
[The Carpentries Lab][lab],
with the option of publication in
[The Journal of Open Source Education][jose] upon acceptance.
Lessons from the Incubator can also be submitted for adoption into
one of The Carpentries existing lesson programs, or,
more rarely for [consideration as a new lesson program][lesson-prog-incubation].
